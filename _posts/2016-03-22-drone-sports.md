# Drone Sports

Car racing leagues like NASCAR get lots of slack for being boring. For outsiders, it's tough to see the fun in watching people drive in circles again and again --- even if they're doing it at 160 miles an hour within an inch of one another.

But what if the vehicles racing against one another weren't cars, but flying robots? That's the idea behind drone racing, where pilots twist, turn and flip their tiny aircraft around complex courses. All this, while their body stays put thanks to special goggles that deliver a first-person view from their drone's camera.
